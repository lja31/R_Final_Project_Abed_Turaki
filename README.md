This project focuses on analyzing mortality trends and the influencing factors in Nigeria, with a particular emphasis on maternal mortality and its correlation with various socio-economic indicators. Using data spanning several decades, we explore the relationship between public health expenditure and maternal mortality rates, the impact of health-related factors such as fertility rates and life expectancy, and how economic growth and demographic trends have influenced public health outcomes. By applying spatial data exploration techniques, time series analysis, and regression models, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of
the dynamics driving maternal health outcomes in Nigeria and to highlight areas for potential intervention and improvement.
